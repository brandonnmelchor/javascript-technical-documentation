# FCC-Technical-Documentation

I built a Technical Documentation Page using vanilla HTML and CSS. I built this for one of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification challenges. Feel free to check it out. Any feedback would be appreciated!

All the documentation from this page was taken from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
