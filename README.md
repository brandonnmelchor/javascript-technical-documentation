# FCC-Technical-Documentation

I built a Technical Documentation Page using vanilla HTML and CSS. I built this for one of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification challenges. Feel free to check it out. Any feedback would be appreciated!

All documentation on this page was taken from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
